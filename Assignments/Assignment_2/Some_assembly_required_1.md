Challenge Page:Some Assembly Required 1(http://mercury.picoctf.net:37669/index.html)
Walkthrough:when we open the aboce link, well be asked to enter flag, firsti entered flag, which is incorrect and next Picotf{}, but that is also incorrect.so i've inspected it, in the sources section, it has javascript file, and wasm folder. if we open wasm folder,well have a file in it , if we open that file, at the last line or end of file , well find the flag(picoCTF{a8bae10f4d9544110222c2d639dc6de6}), now if we entered this flag at original page and submit it,well get Coreect!, so we are done.
Flag:picoCTF{a8bae10f4d9544110222c2d639dc6de6}
